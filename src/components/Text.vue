    <h2>What is Semantic HTML?</h2>
    <p id="first"><i>Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in web pages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its presentation to human users.</i>- <b>Wikipedia</b></p>

This inclusivity ensures that people with disabilities can access and understand your web content effectively.

    <br><br>3. User Experience: Semantic HTML elements convey the structure of your content, making it easier for users to navigate your website. Visitors can quickly identify headers, main content areas, navigation menus, and footers, enhancing their overall experience and reducing confusion.
